# PGR Readme

The files pgr.hpp and pgr.cpp and their contents were taken or inspired by the PGR framework provided for students of computer graphics at FIT CTU and FEL CTU. The framework also included freeglut and other libraries that I do not want to use.

Thanks to Tomas Barak, Petr Felkel and Vlastimil Havran.
